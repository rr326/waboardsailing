<h2 style="background-color: #FFFF00;">DRAFT - Not verified by experts. </h2>

Good place for wind other than offshore. Parking ok when not summer crowds. First day of high pressure is typically the strongest.
Look for Point No Point and West Point readings to be at least 15 or better.

Thermal driven spot. Best wind is usually in the afternoon. Hazards, for beginners getting blown into marina.

## Current and Tides

Golden Gardens is affected by tidal currents, which can be quite strong. It's important to be aware of the tide schedule as it can significantly impact your sailing experience. For instance, a minus tide can expose more of the beach and potential hazards, while a plus tide can create stronger currents. The tides can also create a rip along the shore at certain times, so it's crucial to check the tide tables before heading out.

## Hazards

There are several hazards to be aware of at Golden Gardens. The area has a rocky bottom, which is less fin-friendly compared to sandy areas. There are also underwater obstacles such as old pilings and rocks, especially near the former oil dock area, which can be hazardous if not visible. It's advisable to familiarize yourself with the area during low tide to identify these hazards.

## Waves

Golden Gardens can offer good wave sailing conditions, particularly on northerly winds. The fetch can build up nice waves on the reef from the point to the green bell buoy during low tide. However, the waves can be more challenging during high tides when the water is deeper.

Overall, when planning a trip to Golden Gardens, it's essential to check the wind and tide conditions, be aware of underwater hazards, and prepare for potential weed issues.
