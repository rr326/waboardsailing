# Magnusson Park

*(aka: Mags, Maggie )*

## Overview

There are two main launches in Seattle's Magnusson Park - this one (Mags),
which is best in southerly wind, and [Sail Saind Point](/sites/ssp),
which is best in a northerly.

The ideal wind for mags is a SE - the wind comes in unobstructed and is side
onshore. You *can* sail in a SW, but that is less novice-friendly: the landmass
of the park obstructs the wind and you have to slog or swim out your board
to get to the better wind. Worse, if something goes wrong, the wind is pushing
you away from shore.

That said, Mags is moderately foregiving because unless the wind is very westerly,
there is plenty of land mass for your to slog/swim back to. On the picture below,
the distance between the launch and the boat launch downwind (N) is about 200 yards,
and there's plenty of land mass north of that.
