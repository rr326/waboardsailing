## Overview

<h2 style="background-color: #FFFF00;">DRAFT - Not verified by experts. </h2>
TBD

## Wind Conditions

-   **Best Wind Directions**: Newcastle is ideal for southerly winds, which provide steady conditions suitable for both beginners and experienced sailors. It is resilient to convergence, making it a reliable spot for south winds.
-   **Worst Wind Directions**: Winds with a west component can be gusty and inconsistent, earning Newcastle the nickname "Gust Kastle." SE winds are also not favorable.
-   **Gustiness**: Newcastle can be quite gusty, especially with a west wind component. The wind can be inconsistent, so using a floaty board and a relatively large sail is recommended.

## Beginners

-   Newcastle is  a good spot for beginners due to its large shallow area with a sandy bottom.
-   ?? It looks like there is plenty of room to drift south and walk back, on a northerly.

## Facilities

-   **Parking and Rigging**: Parking is straightforward.  Follow the sidewalk to the shoreline and look for a short trail leading to the sand beach.
-   **Launch Area**: The launch area is nice, with grass rigging and a sandy beach. There are no specific mentions of additional facilities like restrooms or showers.

## Hazards

-   **Submerged Obstacles**: Be aware of snags in the shallows about 50 feet from the shore.
-   **Weeds/Milfoil**: Milfoil can be a significant issue, especially after mid-August, and can be a hassle for foiling.

## vs. OO Denny

OO Denny is good for both north and south winds and is also beginner-friendly. Newcastle might be better for absolute beginners due to its shallow areas and suitability for south winds.
