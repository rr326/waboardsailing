## Overview

AKA "Horse shoe cove boat launch".

*Information Needed*

"I did not do any sailing but took some pics of the windsurf launch Horse Shoe Cove boat launch located 2 miles east of the campground. The lake is really empty this time of year so you can see everything that would normally be covered with water. Looks like a pretty clean launch! No tree stumps or any real noticeable hazards. The water level right now looks to be about 50ft down from high water mark making the beach 100 yards out and the reach 100 yards shorter. Looks like there could be an interesting downwind sandbar that occurs when the water level is somewhere in the middle. I’ve only been thru this area three times and have always noticed a decent breeze, so I’d say it gets a pretty good drainage thermal of 12-18mph pretty regularly. Bring your foiling gear! For all you guys that like to sail around islands there a few of those too."
