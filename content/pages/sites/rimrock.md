# Rimrock

## Overview

AKA "Horse shoe cove boat launch".

In spring and early summer the water level is right up at the trees.  You park and rig under the trees (no grass there). The water is cold, but not as cold as Lake Wenatchee.  Rimrock warms up so that by August you can go out without a wetsuit.

The reach is 3/8 mile on fairly flat water.  There is no discernable current.

The elevation is just under 3,000' so it can be pretty cold, even during the summer.

The wind follows the cross-mountain gradient pattern of the Gorge, Lake Wenatchee, and Lake Cle Elum.  It will typically be calm or easterly until about noon.  Then the westerly comes snarling down from White Pass and keeps a good 15-20 all afternoon and into the evening.  Sometimes stronger.  For one 200 pound windsurfer, with a fin, his most used sail was a 7.5, sometimes 6.5, sometimes 8.5.  He foiled there a few times with 6.4 or 5.0.

## Water Level

Rimrock is a reservoir which drops significantly over the summer. It tends to remain fairly full through July to mid- August, but starts dropping precipitously in mid- to late August.

See the reservoir level chart [here](https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hydromet/wygraph.html?list=rim%20af&daily=rim%20af) to get a sense of the water height.
