# Crescent Beach

## Pros

*   Stunningly beautiful WA beach!
*   Safe cove (when sailing by NW winds).
*   Mild current (but always check tide tables or ask the locals).
*   2 mile wide sand beach to launch from and return to, i.e. you can make your walk of shame look like a leisurely beach walk :wink:
*   Flat & shallow at low tide; mild surf at high tide.
*   Nice family beach destination where one parent can spend quality Time-on-the-Water (ToW), while the other spends quality time with the children building driftwood shelters, or defending your sand castles from the incoming tide, or playing beach soccer or ultimate frisbee, or flying a kite.
*   Likely to see wildlife, especially seals, and you may criss-cross whales feeding in the bay while windsurfing, if you are lucky.
*   If you are not interested in paying the fee and have good control of your board, then you can park at the Salt Creek Beach Parking Lot and launch from the narrow public beach access east of Salt Creek.
*   Family memories for all ages.

## Cons / Cautions

*   Watch for drifwood after storms.
*   Do not try to sneak onto the private beach - west of Salt Creek - without your bracelet; the private beach is patrolled, and trespassing is enforced.
*   Do not expect strong winds.
