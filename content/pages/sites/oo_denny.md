## Overview

<h2 style="background-color: #FFFF00;">DRAFT - Not verified by experts. </h2>
TBD

## Best Wind Directions

*   Very good for northerlies
*   Ok for southerlies?
*   Some confusion - NOT good with westerly component? I would think that was ideal, and easterly would mess it up.

## Beginners

*   Northerlies - good downwind drift setup.
*   Southierlies - harder for drifing?
*   Bad if from the east (offshore) (I assume)

## Parking

*   There are three main parking areas: south end parking next to restrooms, mid parking across the street, and north parking along the street. Parking can be challenging on busy days, with overflow onto the road.
*   Be patient and wait for parking spots to open up, especially on busy days.

## Facilities

*   The park has restrooms available near the south end parking.
*   There is grass available for rigging.

## Hazards

*   Pilings that are not always visible, especially when the water level is high.

## vs. Newcastle

*   Newcastle is a bit further south on the east side but is also good for beginners. It has a large sandy area and is more  resilient to convergence than spots further north.
